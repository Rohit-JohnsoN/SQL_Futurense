->Step 1:Data Exploration with SELECT and FROM

USE world;

SHOW tables FROM world;
DESCRIBE city;
SELECT * FROM city;

DESCRIBE country;
SELECT * FROM country;

DESCRIBE countrylanguage;
SELECT * FROM countrylanguage;

->Step 2:Sorting Results with ORDER BY

SELECT * FROM country ORDER BY population DESC;

SELECT * FROM city ORDER BY countrycode, name;

->Step 3:Filtering Data with WHERE, AND, OR, NOT

1) Select all countries in Europe with a population greater than 50 million:

SELECT * FROM country WHERE continent = 'Europe' AND population > 50000000;

2) Select cities in Brazil or Argentina:

SELECT *FROM city WHERE countrycode = 'BRA' OR countrycode = 'ARG';

->Step 4:Advanced Filtering with IN, NOT IN, BETWEEN, LIKE
1)Select countries in the 'Americas' or 'Asia' continent using IN:

SELECT *FROM country WHERE continent IN ('Americas', 'Asia');

2)Select countries with populations between 10 and 50 million using BETWEEN:

SELECT *FROM country WHERE population BETWEEN 10000000 AND 50000000;
3) Find cities with names starting with 'San' using LIKE:

SELECT *FROM city WHERE name LIKE 'San%';

->Step 5:
Write a query to select the top 10 most populous cities in the world.

SELECT *FROM city ORDER BY population DESC LIMIT 10;

->STEP 6:
Find countries where the HeadOfState is not specified (IS NULL).

SELECT *FROM country WHERE HeadOfState IS NULL;

->STEP 7:
List all unique continents where the countries are located.

SELECT DISTINCT continent FROM country;
